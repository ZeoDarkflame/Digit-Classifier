# Digit-Classifier
Handwritten Digit classifier made using Simple neural networks
Uses tanh activation for Hidden layers and Softmax activation for output layer

Uses MNIST Dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

## Non Conv Net:
batchsize = 1000  
learning_rate = 0.5  
Epochs = 10  
train set accuracy = 90.78%  
test set accuracy = 91.21%  

## ConvNet:
batchsize = 10000  
learning rate (Adam) = 0.01  
Epochs = 10
